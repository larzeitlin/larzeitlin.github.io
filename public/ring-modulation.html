<h2 id="org9bc7668">Ring Modulation and Frequency Shifting</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9bc7668">
<p>
I started reading about this topic when looking for a computationally
cheap way of doing frequency shifting. This is distinct from pitch
shifting:
</p>

<p>
Pitch shifting is a more familiar effect. It moves the energy at all
frequencies a proportional amount up or down. With pitch shifting the
relative distance between each frequency is preserved. If you imagine a
graphed frequency spectrum, with the horizontal axis laid out
logarithmically in Hz, a pitch shifting spectrum will hold it's shape as
is moves back or forth along the Hz axis. The auditory result is to
preserve the timbre while changing the "note".
</p>

<p>
Frequency shifting, however, shifts each frequency in a signal by a set
number of Hz. Since we don't perceive pitch linearly, this has a bizarre
effect on the signal, totally transforming the timbre.
</p>

<p>
You could take a Fourier transform of the signal, apply the
transformation to the spectrum, then re-synthesize the signal to get the
result. However, this is computationally expensive and restrictive.
Lucky, it turns out you can get a pretty good frequency shifting by
exploiting the properties of ring modulation. We'll get to this in a
bit. First let's think about some concepts. Humour me, there is a point
to it all&#x2026;
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org25f4347" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org25f4347">Rethinking basic operations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org25f4347">
<p>
When we think about basic mathematical operations (addition,
subtraction, multiplication, division), our instincts are based in
experience of the natural world, apply mainly to the natural numbers.
For example, when we are counting apples, we expect addition and
multiplication to be operations that increase our number of apples,
while subtraction and division are going to be decreasers. Obviously we
know about the existence of negative numbers, fractions, and so on.
Nonetheless, our instincts about these operations can occasionally be
misleading when thinking about signals.
</p>

<p>
Clearly signals are not apples. They're more like boxes containing both
apples and anti-apples. So it's worth taking a moment to rethink the
basic operations.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgf94a07f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf94a07f">Addition and Subtraction</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf94a07f">
<p>
Thinking about the boxes of apples and anti-apples, subtraction and
addition are not really looking so opposite any more, in fact they are
pretty similar in some senses. Say you have two signals: A = 440 hz sine
wave and B = 100 hz sine wave. The outcome of adding B to A will be a
signal with two frequencies (440 hz, 100 hz). The outcome of subtracting
B from A will also be a signal with two frequencies. Sure, B will be
inversed, but the auditory result is pretty similar to the addition.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org8a876d9" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org8a876d9">Multiplication shows similarity</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8a876d9">
<p>
Rather than thinking of multiplication as an increaser, I like to
visualise it as a <i>test of similarity</i>. It seems like a strange way to
think of multiplication, but it is helpful. Say I want to test how
similar some number A is to some number B. If B is identical to A then
their product will be a perfect square of A. If B is the exact opposite
to A then the product will be the negation of the perfect square of A.
Likewise if B is similar bigger, or similar but smaller, and so on, we
can see this in the product of the two numbers in relation a the square
of A.
</p>

<p>
This sort of logic is most clear when thinking about the product of
signed numbers:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Negative * Negative = Positive (think of it as tested positive for
having a similar sign)</li>

<li>Negative * Positive = Negative (failed the test for sign similarity)</li>

<li>Positive * Negative = Negative (same as above)</li>

<li>Positive * Positive = Positive (similar sign. So positive similarity)</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgb1732cd" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb1732cd">Adding and Multiplying signals</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb1732cd">
<p>
So, how about we multiply some signals together? This is effectively
ring modulation. Ring modulation gets its name from the circular
arrangement of diodes in its analog implementation (I understand nothing
about electronics).
</p>

<p>
The result of ring modulating two signals is the sum and difference pair
of each frequency across the two signals. For example, multiplying a 100
hz sine with a 440 hz sine will result in a signal with frequencies of
540 hz and 340 hz.
</p>

<p>
Okay, two thoughts. Firstly: Great! The sum component of the result
looks like it will be very useful for our frequency shifter. Secondly:
Why does it behave like this?
</p>

<p>
I think we can develop an instinct for why this happens. Before we start
multiplying, first imagine <b>summing</b> two identical functions together.
Let's imagine it with cos(x) for simplicity:
</p>

<p>
\[y = \cos(x) + \cos(x) = 2\cos(x)\]
</p>

<p>
Since our two functions line up perfectly, we've just doubled the
amplitude.
</p>

<p>
How about if they are not exactly the same? If you've ever heard two
notes of very similar but not identical pitches played at the same time
you'll be familiar with the "beating" effect this creates. When they are
both contributing the same sign the sound is louder, then they slip out
of sync and it dips down. This all happens quite quickly and
repetitively, causing the beating. Here are two non-identical sine waves
added together:
</p>

<p>
\[y = \cos(5x) + \cos(6x)\]
</p>


<div id="org913a549" class="figure">
<p><img src="images/5.1.gif" alt="5.1.gif" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
You can see the "beating" effect visually here.
</p>

<p>
Okay, now on to multiplication. What happens if we multiply a signal by
itself? Well, we know that like negative * negative = positive, and
positive * positive = positive, so all the overlapping negative bits are
going to become positive bits. So we'll double the frequency and shift
everything up above the horizontal axis, like so:
</p>

<p>
\[y = \cos(6x) * \cos(6x)\]
</p>


<div id="orgabe291e" class="figure">
<p><img src="images/5.2.gif" alt="5.2.gif" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Notice. We got the sum frequency sin(12x). The difference is zero.
</p>

<p>
Great. How about if we multiply two signals that are not identical?
Let's have a look:
</p>

<p>
\[y = \cos(4x) * \cos(6x)\]
</p>


<div id="org32ab0a2" class="figure">
<p><img src="images/5.3.gif" alt="5.3.gif" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Look carefully and you'll see that whenever ether of the input signals
approaches 0 it pulls the resulting output towards 0. When the two input
signals closely match each other, the output is a high, positive value.
When they are very dissimilar the output is a high negative value. As
discussed above, think of <b>multiplication as a test of similarity</b>.
</p>

<p>
Let's see if we can reproduce the same signal with addition. If we take
the sum and the difference of the signals above&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
\[y = \cos(2x) + \cos(10x)\]
</p>


<div id="orgd5c4966" class="figure">
<p><img src="images/5.4.gif" alt="5.4.gif" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Pretty similar, you can see the same frequencies at work there. However
if we scale it down by a half they look very similar indeed:
</p>


<p>
\[y = [\cos(10x) + \cos(2x) ] \frac{1}{2}\]
</p>


<div id="org785b2d9" class="figure">
<p><img src="images/5.5.gif" alt="5.5.gif" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
So, nothing formally proven here, but we can get a feel for why
multiplication results in the sum and the difference of the input
frequencies:
</p>

<p>
When multiplying two very similar sinusoids there will be a long expanse
of relative similarity which gradually shifts into a long expanse of
relative dissimilarity. That's what is causing the "difference" part of
the output, which is at a low frequency because the two inputs are close
in frequency. If the inputs were very dissimilar frequencies, the
"beating" of the "difference" becomes faster. The "sum" part is due to
both input frequencies constantly pulling the output towards and away
from 0 at their own speed.

<div id="outline-container-org4592020" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4592020">Let's get Triggy with it&#x2026;</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4592020">
<p>
We can see the concept from above taking place in these trig identities.
</p>

<p>
\[\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) = \frac{1}{2} \cos(\alpha âˆ’ \beta) + \frac{1}{2}\cos(\alpha + \beta)\]
</p>

<p>
\[\sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta) = \frac{1}{2} \cos(\alpha âˆ’ \beta) âˆ’ \frac{1}{2}\cos(\alpha + \beta)\]
</p>

<p>
\[\sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) = \frac{1}{2} \sin(\alpha + \beta) + \frac{1}{2}\sin(\alpha âˆ’ \beta)\]
</p>

<p>
\[\cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta) = \frac{1}{2} \sin(\alpha + \beta) âˆ’ \frac{1}{2}\sin(\alpha âˆ’ \beta)\]
</p>

<p>
Considering these identities you can see why I chose to use cosines in
the examples above, it's the simplest version.
</p>

<p>
We'd like to be able to isolate the sums and differences in each of
these. For these simple signals we can show how with a bit of
rearrangement:
</p>

<p>
For example, take the first of the equations above:
</p>

<p>
\[\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) = \frac{1}{2} \cos(\alpha âˆ’ \beta) + \frac{1}{2}\cos(\alpha + \beta)\]
</p>

<p>
\[\sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta) = \frac{1}{2} \cos(\alpha âˆ’ \beta) âˆ’ \frac{1}{2}\cos(\alpha + \beta)\]
</p>

<p>
We can isolate the \[cos(\alpha + \beta)\] term in the first equation
like so:
</p>

<p>
\[\cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) âˆ’ \sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta)=\]
</p>

<p>
\[  \left [ \frac{1}{2} \cos(\alpha âˆ’ \beta) + \frac{1}{2}\cos(\alpha + \beta)  \right ]  âˆ’   \left [ \frac{1}{2} \cos(\alpha âˆ’ \beta) âˆ’ \frac{1}{2}\cos(\alpha + \beta)  \right ] = \]
</p>

<p>
\[    \frac{1}{2} \cos(\alpha âˆ’ \beta) + \frac{1}{2}\cos(\alpha + \beta)   âˆ’   \frac{1}{2} \cos(\alpha âˆ’ \beta) + \frac{1}{2}\cos(\alpha + \beta)   = \]
</p>

<p>
\[cos(\alpha +\beta)\]
</p>

<p>
That's all well and good. However, usually the signals we are processing
will not be simple sinusoids. The above shows that we can isolate that
sum part of the ring modulation, but only in these situations. We need a
general way to isolate the sum part of any signal that has been
multiplied by a <i>carrier signal</i> in order to have a precise frequency
shifter.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgec742b1">
<p>
Here we shift gears and start looking at this all in the frequency
domain.
</p>

<p>
Single-sideband modulation. This is the term used in communications
signal processing for what we are trying to do here. We want to think of
our carrier signal in the frequency domain as a single line representing
that frequency, since it's a sinusoid. Think of this as a center line.
When we apply the carrier to our audio signal the outcome in the
frequency domain will be distributed either side of that line. All the
sum elements will shift above it, all the difference elements are
subtracted away from it and are therefore flipped into the mirror image
of the sum parts. These two sides of the output are called sidebands. We
want to isolate the upper sideband.
</p>


<div id="org3462114" class="figure">
<p><img src="images/5.6.png" alt="5.6.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
From seeing this, your first instinct might be to use a high-pass to
remove the lower sideband. This is an option, but it's a sloppy one. We
want something more exact.
</p>

<p>
If we go back to the trig stuff above, we found that:

\[\cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos(\alpha)\cos(\beta) âˆ’ \sin(\alpha)\sin(\beta))\]

We can generalise this to any real signal like so: Multiply audio signal
\[a\] by our carrier \[cos(\omega)\] and then subtracting that to a copy
of our audio signal that is phase shifted by - 90 degrees and then
multiplied by the carrier but in phase quadrature, so \[\sin(\omega)\].

The diagram above will create either the upper sideband or lower
sideband depending on whether you add or subtract at the end.

Seems simple enough, but how to make that -90 degree phase shifted copy.
We need to filter in some way to cause the phase shift. Conceptually,
what we are after is a Hilbert Transform of our input signal.

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_transform">Hilbert
Transform</a> takes a time domain signal and returns a time domain signal
with all of the positive frequencies shifted - 90 degrees and all of the
negative frequencies + 90 degrees. The maths of the Hilbert transform is
quite complicated in my opinion. We're not going to dwell on it here for
two reasons: it would be a tangential move from our topic, and more
importantly because an ideal discrete time Hilbert filter is actually
impossible to make. So we'll be approximating it. We can do this with a
network of all-pass filters.

<p>
All-pass filters affect the phase spectrum of a signal without changing
the overall energy at each frequency. The result by itself is barely
audible at all since all the same frequencies are retained, but each
part of the spectrum is a tiny bit delayed relative to the frequency.
Since they work by delaying the signal, they affect high frequencies
most and low frequencies least. This isn't ideal for us because we want
to shift all frequencies evenly. The solution is to take our signal,
split it into two and then use a whole bunch of all-passes on each one.
Nether of the outputs will have a flat phase shift compared to the
input, but they will be approximately 90 degrees phase from each other
for a large part of the spectrum.

As for the layout of the all-pass network and the coefficients of the
all-pass filters, it's largely a matter of trial and error. Thankfully
the work has been done for us already.
<a href="http://yehar.com/blog/?p=368">Olli Niemitalo's website</a> provides one
of the most efficient and simple arrangements floating around the web.
Apparently the coefficients were found using a "genetic evolutionary
algorithm". Sounds nerdy as fudge&#x2026; Anyhow it works great.
</p>

<p>
The all-pass network uses four all-pass filters per branch, and then
delays one of them by one sample. In the diagram above the lower branch
is the delayed one. Notice that we invert the lower branch, before
adding it (same as subtracting it). This is because we want the upper,
not the lower sideband. Go back to the trig section of this post to see
why to see why

If you've taken all the info above, put it together and build a
frequency shifter then well done! You may be annoyed to hear some nasty
noises at the top end, especially when you push the carrier frequency
high. This is aliasing. The problem is that the "sum" part of the
multiplication is making frequencies that are beyond Nyquist frequency.
Your options are either low pass filter the signal before it goes in
(lame), or to up-sample both the input signal and carrier oscillator by
a factor of 2, then do the multiplication, THEN low-pass to kill
everything over Nyquist (much cooler). That way you preserve as much as
possible.

Some weird concepts in this one. I spent a long time being concerned
about the two sidebands overlapping, and how could you possibly isolate
them if they were. Turns out they don't, each frequency is added and
subtracted <b>from</b> the carrier frequency, so they lie nicely either side
of it.
</p>

<p>
Also, if you skimmed the trigonometry bit and then felt lost at the end
then give it another pass. Once you see <b>why</b> the multiplication makes
and sum and difference, and <b>how</b> either the sum or difference can be
canceled out then the rest falls into place.

The Hilbert stuff. I feel kind of guilty for not writing more about it.
It's interesting and pretty challenging for me to wrap my head around. I
spent a lot of time researching this article by learning about the
analytic signal and Hilbert transform, then wrote practically nothing
about it. The reason is i decided that it was too great a deviation from
the objective of the article. It's super interesting though. I recommend
starting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_signal">this
Wikipedia page</a>.

Thanks for reading this. I hope it's pulled together all the key
information from various sources so you can use it all as you will. As
ever, I welcome corrections from spelling to calling me out on having it
all totally wrong!
