* Augustiner Braugasthof

#+begin_verse
Clay cups carrying cold beer.
Rapport ripples round the tavern.
In search of solitude I sat
And bade the keeper bring a flagon.

I heard a laugh I knew too well;
A lass I'd known from long before.
I turned to see, she was not there.
I must have dreamt her laughter fair.

And now my ale is almost done.
Have I time to take another?
Or pay my dues and wander on
Till I forget how I loved her.
